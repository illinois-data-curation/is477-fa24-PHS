Overview
The film industry’s influence on global culture is immense, and box office success often becomes a key indicator of a movie’s reach and profitability. With a surge in content across various genres, identifying trends and factors that influence high box office earnings has become crucial for studios and analysts alike. Our project aims to investigate specific genre-related trends and other variables that correlate with greater box office success, thereby helping industry professionals and researchers understand what makes movies perform well in theaters.

Research Questions

What movie genres are associated with higher box office earnings?
Are there recurring factors across top-performing genres that correlate with high box office revenue?
Team
Our team has opted for a collaborative approach to ensure a comprehensive analysis, with all members sharing responsibilities across data collection, cleaning, and analysis. This structure allows us to leverage collective insights during each project phase, from research and acquisition to integration and reporting.

Datasets

Box Office Revenue Data
This dataset provides detailed historical box office revenue figures for various movies, segmented by genre, production budget, release year, and earnings. Sourced from The Numbers or Box Office Mojo, the dataset includes columns such as Movie Title, Genre, Domestic Earnings, International Earnings, Worldwide Earnings, Budget, and Release Date. This data will allow us to pinpoint genres that consistently perform well at the box office, as well as explore other factors such as budget and international appeal.

IMDB Movie Metadata
This dataset contains comprehensive movie metadata from IMDB, including information on cast, crew, runtime, genres, and user ratings. The inclusion of IMDB user ratings and detailed genre breakdowns helps enrich our analysis, as we can correlate viewer preferences, star power, and genre popularity with box office earnings. The columns in this dataset include Title, Genre, Director, Cast, Runtime, Rating, and Votes.
